Sky Chase Game
By: Kimberly Ko, Ryder Wang, and William Wen

This is our game, Sky Chase! It was coded using python in Processing.
We implemented lots of object-oriented programming to create all our characters and features.
A "Movable" class was used to track the hitboxes, position, velocity, and acceleration of all movable objects.
It became the parent class for the player and the enemy classes.
There are also shape classes (circle and rectangle) that detect when objects interact or collide and update positions

Features:
- Nintendo themed characters and obstacles
- Boundaries to the area that the character must stay in
- Moveable player character that can be controlled with a mouse
- Homing enemies that chase the player character --> will result in "game over" when they touch
- There are different obstacles to avoid:
	We made "hard obstacles" like sticky walls which stop the character, and "soft obstacles" like clouds that slow the character down.
	The sizes and positions of all obstacles are randomly generated for a unique experience each game
