    <p>This is our game, Sky Chase! It was coded using python in Processing.
        We implemented lots of object-oriented programming to create all our characters and features.
        A "Movable" class was used to track the hitboxes, position, velocity, and acceleration of all movable objects.
        It became the parent class for the player and the enemy classes.
        There are also shape classes (circle and rectangle) that detect when objects interact or collide and update positions </p>
