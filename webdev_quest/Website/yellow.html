    <h2> Patch 1.0.0</h2>
    <li>
        Nintendo themed characters and obstacles
    </li>
    <li>
        Boundaries to the area that the character must stay in
    </li>
    <li>
        Moveable player character that can be controlled with a mouse
    </li>
    <li>
        Homing enemies that chase the player character
    </li>
    <li>
        There are different obstacles to avoid: We made "hard obstacles" like sticky walls which stop the character, and "soft obstacles" like clouds that slow the character down.
    </li>
    <li>
        The sizes and positions of all obstacles are randomly generated for a unique experience each game
    </li>
